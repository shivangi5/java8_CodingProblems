Can Kelly solve enough code challenges to catch up with Sam?

Sam and Kelly are programming buddies. Kelly resolves to practice more as Sam is ahead initially. They each solve a number of problems daily. Find the minimum number of days for Kelly to have solved more problems than Sam. If Kelly cannot surpass return -1.

Example

samDaily = 3

kellyDaily = 5

difference = 5

Initially, Sam has solved difference problems more than Kelly. Each day, they solve samDaily and kellyDaily problems each.

Day 1: samSolved = difference + samDaily = 5 + 3 = 8

_            kellySolved_ = _kellyDaily = _5

Day 2: samSolved = 8 + 3 = 11

_            kellySolved_ = 5 + 5 = 10

Day 3: samSolved = 11 + 3 = 14

_            kellySolved_ = 10 + 5 = 15

Sam is 5 problems ahead of Kelly and they solve 3 and 5 problems a day. Sam will be ahead by only 3 after the first day, 1 after the second, and Kelly will pass Sam on day 3.

**Function Description **

Complete the function minNum in the editor below.

minNum has the following parameter(s):

    samDaily:  Number of problems Sam solves in a day

    kellyDaily:  Number of problems Kelly solves in a day

    difference_:_  Number of problems Sam is ahead to begin

Return

    _int: _the minimum number of days needed by Kelly to exceed Sam, or -1 if it is impossible

Constraints

1 ≤ samDaily, kellyDaily ≤ 100
0 ≤ difference ≤ 100

public static int minNum(int samDaily, int kellyDaily, int difference) {
    int day = 0;
    int samSolved = difference;
    int kellySolved = 0;

    while (samSolved >= kellySolved) {
        day++;
        samSolved += samDaily;
        kellySolved += kellyDaily;

        if (day > 1000000) { // Avoid infinite loops
            return -1;
        }
    }

    return day;
}
